Manage is just and idea on how to run the scipt.
You need to give it root acsses so my example is a small scipt that is exacutable in a dir that has been exported to my path var

-flags are -a and -r at this point.
With -a the script does not run apt auto remove.
With -r it takes the package list and removes it instead of installing it.
export example:
export PATH=$PATH:(dir)
the PATH is the varibale that holds where the os searcher for exacutables.

chmod +x makes things exacutable
